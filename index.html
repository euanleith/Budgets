        <div id="removePoliciesDescription">
            <p>Policies which are proposed to receive reduced spending or removal/reduction in the future can be seen on the positive side of the chart, as they are still being paid for in this year's budget.</p>
            <p>Policies which are proposed to be removed can be seen in the negative side of the chart, as they are no longer contributing to the total expenditure. However it should be noted that a lack of expenditure is not the same as new income.</p>
            <p>Some of the arguments for and against these policies will be explored below:</p>
            <details>
            <summary>HAP/RAS</summary>
            <p>The opposition parties are all proposing to remove or significantly reduce expenditure towards the HAP and RAS schemes in the long run, to be replaced with increased funding towards new social housing (todo source). The incumbent parties have maintained their confidence in the schemes.</p>
            <p>todo they also believe that it is currently underfunded</p>
            <p>The stated arguments against the schemes are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>They don't increase the total stock of housing.</b> The lack of housing is a significant factor in the increase in house prices, so HAP/RAS don't actually solve the problem of increased house prices.</li>
                <li><b>They leave the government with no long term asset</b> (socdems budget end of pg22, labour budget pg37, also socdems email). Money that is spent on these policies is lost, rather than being maintained in the form of an asset, as would be the case is this money was instead used to fund new government owned social housing.</li>
                <li><b>The value for money is claimed to be worse than funding new social housing.</b> The repeated long term cost of HAP/RAS is believed to outweigh the single short term cost of building/acquiring new social housing. (socdems budget end of pg22, sf - https://vote.sinnfein.ie/gap-in-hap-thresholds-and-rent-rates-highlights-how-government-reliance-on-private-rented-sector-is-failing-tenants-eoin-o-broin-td/, also socdems email)</li>
                <li><b>Tenants under HAP/RAS don't have long-term security of tenure</b> (https://www.sinnfein.ie/housing-4). This reduces tenants' peace of mind regarding their finances and security, as well as the feeling of having a 'home'.</li>
                <li>todo remove? <b>They potentially cause rents to increase.</b> Through HAP/RAS the government is effectively competing on behalf of renters under these schemes against private renters for the limited stock of existing leases. This increased competition without a proportional increase in supply is proposed to cause prices to rise. (see socdems email, https://businessplus.ie/news/hap-rents/ (not a good source)). And further, this creates a vicious cycle where rents are increased, which requires HAP/RAS spending to increase, which increases rents further.</li>
                <li><b>They're hard to be stopped once they're started.</b> If these schemes were to stop tomorrow, recipients would no longer be able to afford rent, and many would become homeless. Therefore, the government is required to maintain a high level of spending to avoid this outcome. Because of this, the opposition parties are proposing spending reductions over the long run (see socdems email, other...) todo also people who are currently on HAP/RAS will be personally incentivised to vote for parties who maintain the programme, because removing the programmes will put their renting situation into question.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However the incumbent parties respond todo</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>They reduce homelessness by helping those who can't afford or can barely afford rent.</b> With rent prices so high, the number of people at risk of homelessness is high. todo etc. etc</li>
                <li><b>They believe that competition through the private housing market is a better means for reducing house prices than the public sector.</b> Therefore they don't want to acquire/build too much social housing as this will disrupt competition (todo ?). (https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41256136.html).</li>
                <li><b>They believe that the value for money is positive compared to new social housing.</b> currently costs an average of €9000/y, whereas acquiring them would cost 'a couple of hundred thousand' - https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41256136.html. or in more general terms, they believe the yearly cost is so much smaller than the cost of acquisition that its better to just pay the former.</li>
                <li>todo security of tenure - there are laws assuring security of tenure for 6 months or something</li>
