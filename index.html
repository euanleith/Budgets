                                <p>All parties support an increase in social housing to support low-income households and reduce homelessness. However, the opposition parties have also expressed their intention to increase supply as a means to reducing house prices. The opposition parties believe that the current targets for new social housing are too low. Furthermore, they note that targets from previous years haven't been met. The incumbent parties have stated their intention to increase their targets in line with recent reports, and have cited a number of roadblocks which have impeded development. They have also noted that despite this, there has still been a significant increase in delivery of social housing under their government.</p>

                                <h3>Definition</h3>
                                <p>A public-private partnership (PPP) is an arrangement between a public authority and a private partner designed to deliver a public infrastructure project or service under a long-term contract. In the case of this PPP project, the private partner will finance and construct the homes, then provide maintenance and tenancy management services for a 25 year service period with the homes maintained to a pre-defined standard. The homes remain in local authority ownership<a class="citation" href="#PPPPressRelease"></a>.</p>
                                <h3>Summary of discussion</h3>
                                <p>The opposition parties (todo which ones?) claim that there are various problems (todo list) with the scheme which could all be avoided by just building social housing directly. The incumbent parties disagree, claiming that the scheme produces houses faster while not being worse value than direct builds.</p>
