                    <li>The incumbent parties Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Green Party (FFG) spending around €4B.</li>

Information regarding each policy can be seen be hovering over them with the mouse. Groups can be hidden by clicking their name in the legend, and isolated by double-clicking their name.</p>
                <p>It's evident that the most significant spending group is new social housing, with both the highest expenditure and difference in expenditure between parties. todo parties think its the most important thing<a class="citation" href="#SFHousing2024"></a><a class="citation" href="#LPBudget"></a><a class="citation" href="#SDBudget"></a><a class="citation" href="#PBPBudget"></a>(todo also affordable housing?).</p>
                <p>The distribution of spending towards new social housing follows the same pattern as before, with the incumbent parties FFG spending the least at €1.8B, followed by SF, Labour and SD proposing increases of around €1-1.5B, and PBP proposing a greater increase of around €3.6B.</p>
                <p>todo discuss - ffg think more houses is unrealistic etc. maybe do this after showing ffg proposed vs. actual new social housing? definitely mention will be discussed more though</p>

                                <p>All parties are proposing to significantly reduce expenditure in the long run, as new social housing fulfills those needs. They have all acknowledged the benefits of the scheme. However, the opposition parties note that despite being considered a short term fix, spending has increased significantly over time. The opposition parties claim that the government isn't building enough new social housing to replace these schemes; while the incumbent parties claim that significantly more houses are being built each year, and that the crisis is already starting to be fixed.</p>

As HAP/RAS tenancies fall under the legal definition of council housing, they are excluded from figures for social housing needs. However, short term rent supplement recipients are still included in these figures, despite both programmes not providing for long term housing needs. Therefore this distinction is arbitrary, and is only being used to hide to severity of the crisis. todo this also removes them from the waiting list for social housing, which means they'll be stuck with HAP, and if they get kicked out they have to go through a bunch of paperwork to get on social housing.</li>

Through HAP/RAS the government is effectively competing on behalf of renters under these schemes against private renters for the limited stock of existing leases. This increased competition without a proportional increase in supply is proposed to cause prices to rise.

However, as previously explained, the opposition parties simultaneously support short term increases in HAP/RAS spending, and greater increases in spending towards new social housing than the incumbent parties are proposing, which would allow for reduced HAP/RAS spending in the long run. todo though FFG would just claim that their new social housing spending is sufficient. so its really just a tangential argument about the amount of new social housing spending.</li>-->
