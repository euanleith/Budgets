They have all acknowledged the benefits of the scheme. However, the opposition parties note that despite being considered short term measures, spending towards these policies has increased significantly over time. They claim that the government isn't building enough new social housing to replace these schemes; while the incumbent parties claim that significantly more houses are being built each year, and that the crisis is already starting to be fixed.</p>-->
                                <p>Despite being considered short term measure since they don't reduce house prices, spending towards these schemes has increased significantly over time. The opposition parties claim that the government isn't building enough new social housing to replace these schemes. The incumbent parties disagree, claiming that a significant increase in new social houses being built is starting to fix the crisis, which will presumably relieve dependency on these schemes.</p>

As HAP/RAS tenancies fall under the legal definition of council housing, they are excluded from figures for social housing needs.

Therefore this distinction is arbitrary, and is only being used to hide to severity of the crisis. todo this also removes them from the waiting list for social housing, which means they'll be stuck with HAP, and if they get kicked out they have to go through a bunch of paperwork to get on social housing.</li>

Without this, private developers can receive substantial subsidies while still charging unaffordable prices. Labour proposes to add this condition, while Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats believe that the money would be better spent on new social and affordable housing.</li>

They claim that in 2022 cost per unit was estimated to be around €80,000; this has increased to €135,000 in 2024. Therefore either funding will have to increase to meet the housing target, or the target will have to be decreased.</li>
                                        <li><b>Sinn Féin claims that the current progress doesn't seem to be on track to reach targets</b><a class="citation" href="#SFCroiConaitheArticle"></a>. As of July 2024, contracts have been signed for the building of 582 units. However, the target is 5,000 units. Sinn Féin claims that 'given that apartment developments typically take two years to complete, time is running out for contracts to be signed to meet the target'.</li>

                                <p>The First Home (FHS) and Help to Buy (HTB) schemes help residents who are buying or building their first home. Under HTB this is in the form of a tax refund<a class="citation SF" href="#HTB"></a>. And under FHS, the government and participating banks pay up to 30% of the cost of the home in return for a stake in it. This stake can be bought back by the resident at any time<a class="citation SF" href="#FHS"></a>. See here for more info on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/">First Home Scheme</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/">Help to Buy</a>.</p>
                                <h3>Summary of arguments</h3>
                                <p>The incumbent parties claim that these schemes save buyers money, and help tenants get out of expensive rental accommodation. Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, and Labour claim they don't reduce the cost of housing, or even cause prices to increase, and therefore don't fix the underlying problem of the housing crisis. They believe therefore that the money would be better spent on new social and affordable housing.</p>

                                        <li><b>In fact, Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, and Labour claim that the First Home scheme pushes up house prices</b><a class="citation SF" href="#SFFHS/HTB"></a><a class="citation LP" href="#LPFHS"></a><a class="citation SD" href="#SDFHS"></a>. They cite reports from the Central Bank of Ireland and London School of Economics, which have shown that a similar scheme in England has increased house prices<a class="citation" href="#CBFHS"></a><a class="citation" href="#LSEFHS"></a>. These reports conclude that the scheme has mostly helped middle-income households buy more expensive houses than they would otherwise, rather than helping low-income renting households to get a mortgage, since house prices are still too high even with government assistance. This means that buyers spend more while demand for new houses doesn't increase, which causes 'upward price pressures' for the wider market. Sinn Féin also claims that according to experts, the same is the case for the Help to Buy scheme<a class="citation SF" href="#FHS/HTBArticle"></a>.</li>

                                <p>A public-private partnership (PPP) is an arrangement between a public authority and a private partner designed to deliver a public infrastructure project or service under a long-term contract. In the case of this PPP project, the private partner will finance and construct the homes, then provide maintenance and tenancy management services for a 25 year service period with the homes maintained to a pre-defined standard. The homes remain in local authority ownership<a class="citation" href="#PPP"></a>.</p>
