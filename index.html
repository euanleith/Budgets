            <p>The most significant spending item is new social housing, with both the highest expenditure and difference in expenditure between parties.

            <p>There appears to be little difference between parties on other spending items, but this is partly because of the high proportion of spending on social housing. You can click on 'New social housing' in the legend to hide it, and make the other differences more apparent. </p>
            <p>Items can also be double-clicked on to focus on them.</p>

                <li><b>Disadvantaged groups</b>: Most opposition parties +€100m (increases to traveller accommodation, disability and elderly grants, and homeless services), and SF +€230m (greater spending on homeless services).</li>
                <li><b>Defects</b>: Differs a decent amount party to party from €70-190m, but PBP spending significantly more at €510m.</li>
